## Current Status

The project is in active development, with significant progress made on implementing API method pages, creating Alkanes explorer pages, and integrating Bitcoin wallet functionality. We're now focused on addressing a critical network switching race condition by implementing a URL-based network architecture to ensure data consistency across network changes. The core functionality is implemented, and we're working on enhancing reliability, user experience, and adding additional API methods.

## Known Issues

### 1. Explorer Pages Issues
- The "Show unverified WASM contracts" checkbox styling has been fixed, but filtering functionality is not working correctly
- When toggling the checkbox to show unverified contracts, it doesn't display all missing tokens
- Results are being cut short for all tokens, affecting pagination
- Pagination controls have been improved but still don't work correctly
- Need to investigate if we should fetch all tokens first and then handle pagination client-side

### 2. Network Switching Race Condition
- Network switching can cause race conditions when switching rapidly between networks
- UI can display data from one network while showing a different network is selected
- This is a critical issue that undermines application reliability
- Resolving this issue is our current priority by implementing URL-based network architecture

### 2. Browser Compatibility
- Some Node.js features are not fully compatible with the browser environment
- Buffer implementation is limited and may not handle all cases
- File system operations are mocked and don't persist data

### 3. Error Handling
- Some error messages could be more user-friendly
- Error recovery could be improved in some components
- Network errors need better handling and retry mechanisms
- Wallet connection errors need specific handling

### 4. Performance
- Large result sets can cause performance issues
- Some API calls to mainnet can be slow
- No caching mechanism for frequently accessed data
- LaserEyesProvider may impact initial load time

### 5. UI/UX
- Loading states could be improved
- Form validation needs enhancement
- Mobile responsiveness needs improvement
- Some links may not work correctly if routes are not properly defined
- Wallet selection UI could be enhanced with wallet icons

### 6. Wallet Integration
- Not all wallets may be available in all browsers
- Some wallets may have specific requirements or limitations
- Error handling for wallet-specific issues needs improvement
- Network alignment between METAGRAPH and wallet providers needs testing

18. **Updated SDK Implementation**: Updated the traceTransaction function in the SDK to correctly use the AlkanesRpc trace method.

19. **Removed Mock Data**: Successfully removed all mock data from the application and implemented real data fetching through the Oyl SDK.

20. **Browser Compatibility**: Implemented a comprehensive Node.js compatibility layer that allows the Oyl SDK to run in a browser environment.

## Next Priorities

1. **Implement URL-based Network Architecture**: Build the NetworkProvider and NetworkNav components, update the route configuration, and adapt existing pages to use network from URL parameters to eliminate the race condition issue.

2. **Enhance SDK with AbortController Support**: Update SDK functions to support request cancellation with AbortController to prevent race conditions during network changes.

3. **Implement Redirect Logic**: Create redirects from old URL patterns to new ones to maintain backward compatibility during the transition.

4. **Enhance Wallet Functionality**: Expand wallet functionality to include transaction history, balance display, and transaction sending interface.

5. **Implement Additional API Methods**: Complete the implementation of the remaining API methods from the method matrix.

6. **Enhance User Experience**: Improve navigation between method pages, add more interactive examples, and implement better error handling and feedback.

7. **Complete Integration Testing**: Test all API methods and wallet functionality with real data across different network environments.
